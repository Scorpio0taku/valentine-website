This is just a message to show you how much I appreciate you and care for you. I'm thankful for you being here. You're just a wonderful, unique, and great person overall. I think that's one of the things that draws me to you. Because to be honest, I don't even know how I'm in this kind of situation again. Last year, I thought I was done with relationships, but here I am. Two months later, a finished man. I mean, if the me of November or early December last year could see me now, they'd probably be shaking their heads, wondering why I'm in a relationship again after I swore I would never enter one. But you know, nobody knows where life takes you. I don't think I've ever been in a relationship where the person gives me the majority of what I give them. You know, when it comes to expressing feelings. Maybe it's because I've dated toxic people, or I'm the toxic one, or it's my lack of emotional expression, but I don't know. You are the first person who's told me that you love me—outside of my family. And actually, that day you said it, I was really touched. I don't know. I literally went to bed smiling. And every time I feel weird, I go back and replay it over and over and over and over again.

I love you.

I don't think there's any other way I can put it. I'm just thankful to have you in my life. And I'm thankful you gave me this opportunity. I will try my best not to let you down or disappoint you. It's not going to be easy for me, but I will definitely try my best to meet your expectations to the best of my ability. Obviously, it's not going to be perfect, but I hope you stay in my life forever, and I can keep planning towards the future. You know, I'm still waiting for the day you sing for me. But they say good things come to those who wait, so I guess I'll just have to wait—especially to see you in person. If you don't run and jump into my arms when I see you, there's actually going to be a problem. I'm going to wait. I'm going to savor every moment until then. Until we meet face to face. And then the relationship moves to a different level. 
So I'll be waiting.

So we can go through this together.

Me and you.

One plus one equals one.

So once again, thank you.

I love you.
